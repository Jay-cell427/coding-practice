# Coding Practices Repository

This repository is dedicated to the various coding 
practices and exercises that I have been working on. The goal is to document my growth and
progress in the field of programming and to mprove my skills through consistent practice

## overview
 This repository contains files that demonstrate the practices that I have been engaging in. 
 The files may include various algorithms, projects, or specific coding challenges I've worked
 on to develop my coding skills.

 ## coding practices
 ** Algorithms: Implementation of common algorithms such as searching, recursion, sorting etc.
 ** Data structures: examples of common data structures like arrays, Dictionaries, 
 ** Languages inluded: Python, C
 ** Problem solving: solutions to coding problems from various sources like codewars, Leetcode and HackerRank

 ## Goals
 1. Improving my understanding of data structures and algorithms
 2. Getting better at writing clean, efficient and maintanable code.
 3. Experimenting with different programming languages and paradigms.
 4. Documenting my coding practices and sharing them for future reference.
 

## Technologies used 
Python - main language for most practices
C
Code-oss for writing and testing code
Jupyter Notebook- for writing and testing code
